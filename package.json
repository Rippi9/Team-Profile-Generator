  "description": "## Your Task Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.  Because this Challenge will require the use of the `Inquirer` package, ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4. To do so, use the following command in your project folder: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you will also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test. Because this application will not be deployed, you will need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You will need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.",
